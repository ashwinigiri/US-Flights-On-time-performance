## Slide 1 Intro
- The project is Airline on-time performance. It is a visual representation and analysis of the flights data -that include arrival delay, departure delay, average taxi time to and from any airport across United States.
- The goal of the project is to create an analysis of the data that is visually appealing to the users which is easily understandable and interpretable.

## Slide 2 Audience
- Our project is useful to frequent travellors, which gives an insight on which carrier is best suitable for them. People with connecting flights can look into and analyse any delay before booking their flights. It is a great platform for people to plan their business meetings by checking if there is any usual delay (flight, taxi) to attain buffer time before the meeting.

##  Slide 3 Interesting
- The moto of this project is to provide delay statistics of airline carriers in one roof. Mere representation of statistical data would take more time for the passenger to obtain the right kind of information. Thus, we hve introduced visual representations in the form of various graphs such as mp, bar, donut etc that would navigate the viewer in obtaining the desired information and also creating an interest among the viewers.

## Slide 4 Data
- We retrieved data from the United States Department of Transportation. (https://www.transtats.bts.gov). The data has been refined according to the type of charts created. Charts like map contain fields such as origin-city and destination-city where as bar chart contains fields such as depr and arrival delay. The data has been aggregated for each month which has been used to create the charts.

## Slide 5 Research
- Our research was mainly focussed on understanding the already existing visualizations on on-time flight performance in the US and digging into the aspects that we wanted to improve on such that the traveller can make an informed decision on his travel.

## Slide 6 Who did what
- Pallavi: Proportional symbol map of airport connectivity and inbound and outbound airport connections.

## Slide 7 Who did what
- Ashwini: Bipartite chart, Line chart for Carrier delay, Carrier-delay component, video for project.

## Slide 8 Who did what
- Laksh: Home page, navigation, dot map for that populates bar chart for departure and arrival delay.

## Slide 9 Design timeline
- Ideation, Dataset, UI Mockup, front end, back end, publishing , feedback and development. We have accomplished the project in 5 phases. First we ideated wherein we thought about what to implement and where to get the data from. Then we planned what all visualizations to use, based on researching already existing systems and visualizations. In the third phase we implemented the front end first and then the back end. In the 4th phase we published our project and rendering feedback forms. In the last phase tried to improve the system based on the feedbacks acquired.

## Slide 10 Design Consideration
- Cairo wheel: we followed the cairo wheel to maintain balance between all functionalities such as unidimensionality and multidimensionality, abstraction and figuration.

## Slide 11 Technologies used 
- We  used different web technologies for the frontend and backend. Bootstrap is a CSS library which we 
 used which made our website scalable at different resolution and screen size. D3.js is 
what we've learnt in this class and we used it to create visualizations for this website. We used angular framework. Apart from this we used CSS, HTML,Javascript, particles.js and python.

## Slide 12 Color Scheme
- We have used blue color throughout our project so that it would address colour blind people as well. D3 scaleLinear and scaleOrdinal have been used for the visualizations.

## Slide 13 D3 Usage: Maps
- We have used maps to represent various cities of the US to represent the connections between them. Two types of maps have been created a dop map and a proportional symbol map.
- US flights dot map that populates a bar chart which displays aggregated value of departure delay of all carriers of selected city. The delay in the bar chart based on carriers can be sorted according to ascending, descending or alphabetical order.
- Airport Connectivity: Airports in all cities of US are represented as a proportional symbol map determined by the size of the airport. It displays all the connecting airports from the user selected airport.


## Slide 14 Responsive
- The webiste is responsive and can be accessible from any device.

## Slide 15 Interactive
The website contains interactive visualizations:
- Carrier Statistics represented by a line chart which shows busy airports which is determined by the count of inbound and outbound flights of various cities in the US.
- Carrier Information chart represents the average arrival and departure delay of the selected carrier in minutes along with a card that contains information about carrier type.
- US on-time flight performance visualized through a bipartite graph. The left side represents two-way verticle bipartite matchings between cause of delay and flight carriers. The right side represents cause of delay Vs major aiports.

## Slide 16 Transitions
- We made an interactive bar chart that shows orders the delay of various carriers according to ascending, descending and alphabetical order. 

## Slide 17 Choice of forms
- We chose forms such as map to represent cities in the US, bar chart to show comparision and line chart to display values over a period since it would make it easy for the user to understand 
the data just by a glance through the visualizations.

## Slide 18 Originality
- The project gives users an insight of planes, airports, carriers etc. This will allow to make analysis to users to plan their travel time. It also gives an opportunity to the aviation managers to analyse any delays and make improvements to attain benefits.
Many of the flight booking websites provide information on carriers, price and time. Our project is to add a new parameter of delay associated so that the viewers can make a more informed decision on his travel. We created a website that contains visual representations of various graphical forms such as maps, bar, donut etc. Each of the charts represent information such as delays, airport connections between cities, daily statistics of flight delay and also the cause of delays.
 
## Slide 19 Questions?
 - This slide was created to welcome any questions from our audience and professor. And a thankyou note for giving us an opportunity to make this project
